# What is MesoHOPS?
Documentation: [mesohops.readthedocs.io](https://mesohops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

MesoHOPS is a formally exact trajectory based approach for solving the time evolution of open quantum systems coupled to non-Markovian thermal environments. MesoHOPS extends the Hierarchy Of Pure States (HOPS) formalism to leverage the dynamic localization present in the wave functions and construct an adaptive basis. Using the adaptive basis MesoHOPS is able to be computationally tractable with large system sizes. 


# Why use MesoHOPS?
To summarize our MesoHOPS algorithm:
1.  is a formally exact solution to the time evolution of a quantum state coupled to a non-Markovian thermal reservoir
2.  is embarrassingly parallel
3.  scales to large systems
4.  is well documented
5.  is open source
